# MathApp
This is an app that I made to explore some fun pieces of mathematics.
## Contents
Currently, the app contains the following:
- Summing all integers in a certain interval [n,m].
- Calculating factorials for very large numbers.
- Solving the geometric series (i.e. ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1&plus;x&plus;x%5E2&plus;x%5E3&plus;...)) for any x element of (-1,1).
- Calculating the number e, by solving (1+1/n)^n for large values of n (i.e. taking n->infinity).
- Calculating simple derivatives from user input.
- Encrypting and decrypting messages to share with your friends via making and solving a pseudo-random system of equations.
- Unit conversions, currently supported: Fahrenheit-Celcius, pounds-kilograms, miles-kilometers and vice versa.
- Randomly generated math problems to work on your ability to solve systems of equations.
- An actual calculator that requires a string as input.
- Currency converter that's automatically updated.
